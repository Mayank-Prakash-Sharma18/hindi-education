इस लेख में हम अंग्रेजी के एक महत्त्वपूर्ण अध्याय के बारे में जानेंगे - <strong>Changes in Tenses while converting Direct Speech into Indirect Speech, in Hindi (हिंदी में)</strong>

इस लेख में, हम अध्ययन करेंगे कि जब हम direct speech को indirect speech में परिवर्तित करते हैं तो हम काल (tenses) कैसे बदलते हैं।

</div>

## जब रिपोर्टिंग क्रिया वर्तमान काल या भविष्य काल में हो (Reporting verb in Present tense or Future tense)

यदि reporting verb (या principal verb) वर्तमान काल या भविष्य काल में है, तो हम direct speech/reported speech के tense को नहीं बदलते हैं।

She says, “Mak was a teacher". <br>
She says that Mak was a teacher. (Mak was a teacher -  reported speech, tense में कोई बदलाव नहीं)

He will say, “I am not the culprit". <br>
He will say that he is not the culprit. (he is not the culprit - reported speech, tense में कोई बदलाव नहीं)


## जब रिपोर्टिंग क्रिया भूतकाल में हो  (Reporting verb in Past tense)

जब reporting verb भूतकाल में होती है (और reported speech मुहावरा/वाक्यांश आदि नहीं है), direct/reported speech के सभी tenses संबंधित भूत काल में बदल जाते हैं। अर्थात्:

* <p> केस 1: Simple present (\(V_1\)/do/does) को Simple past (\(V_2\)/did) में बदल दिया जाता है। </p>
* <p> केस 2: Simple past (\(V_2\)/did) को Past perfect (had + \(V_3\)) में बदल दिया जाता है। </p>
* <p> केस 3: Past perfect (had + \(V_3\)) नहीं बदला जाता है। </p>

### सामान्य नियमों के अपवाद (Exceptions to general rules)

#### अपवाद 1

स्थायी स्थिति या सार्वभौमिक सत्य के मामले में Tenses:

यदि reporting verb 'अतीत' में है, और रिपोर्ट किया गया भाषण (reported speech) अभी भी प्रासंगिक है (यानी एक सार्वभौमिक सत्य/वाक्यांश/मुहावरे/आदतन क्रिया/ऐतिहासिक तथ्य)।

ऐसे मामले में, हम अक्सर चुन सकते हैं कि मूल tenses को वैसे ही रखना है, या उन्हें बदलना है। <br>
<img src="../../../images/english/narration/narration-4.png" alt="Direct and Indirect speech" style="width:99%;height:99%;">

यदि reporting verb भूत काल में है, तो हम निम्नलिखित मामलों में reported clause में भूत काल प्रयोग करना पसंद करते हैं (वर्तमान काल के बजाय):

* हमें यकीन नहीं है कि हम जो रिपोर्ट कर रहे हैं वह अनिवार्य रूप से सच है
* वह स्थिति हो सकता है की अब मौजूद न हो 
* जब हम निष्पक्ष रूप से रिपोर्ट कर रहे हों (reporting objectively)

निम्नलिखित वाक्यों की तुलना करें:

Jim told me that he ***has*** three cars. (told – reporting verb भूत काल में है; has – reported clause की क्रिया वर्तमान काल में है; यह बताता है कि जो रिपोर्ट किया जा रहा है वह वास्तव में सच है, यानी Jim के पास तीन कारें हैं।)

Jim told me that he ***had*** three cars. (told – reporting verb भूत काल में है; had – reported clause की क्रिया भूत काल में है; यह बताता है कि जो रिपोर्ट किया जा रहा है वह या तो सच नहीं है, या वह स्थिति अब उपस्थित नहीं है, यानी या तो Jim के पास कभी तीन कारें थीं ही नहीं, या उसके पास कभी तीन कारें थीं, लेकिन अब नहीं।)

<div class="toc-mak">
  <img src="../../../images/pencil.png">
  <b>नोट</b><br>

यदि reporting verb 'वर्तमान' में है, और हम एक स्थायी स्थिति या सार्वभौमिक सत्य की रिपोर्ट कर रहे हैं, तो भी हम रिपोर्ट किए गए खंड (reported clause) की क्रिया के लिए वर्तमान काल का उपयोग करते हैं।

Aanya ***thinks*** that she ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">spent</span>*** about 15 minutes on a typical meeting with a customer. (गलत) <br>
Aanya ***thinks*** that she ***<span class="mak-text-color">spends</span>*** about 15 minutes on a typical meeting with a customer. (सही; thinks – reporting verb वर्तमान काल में है; spends – reported clause की क्रिया भी वर्तमान काल में है)

British scientists ***claim*** that they ***<span class="mak-text-color-incorrect">developed</span>*** a new vaccine for Covid-19. (गलत) <br>
British scientists ***claim*** that they ***<span class="mak-text-color">have developed</span>*** a new vaccine for Covid-19. (सही; claim – reporting verb वर्तमान काल में है; have developed – reported clause की क्रिया भी वर्तमान काल में है)
</div>

#### अपवाद 2: तत्काल कार्रवाई/क्रिया-प्रतिक्रिया के मामले में Tenses

तत्काल क्रिया (instant action) या क्रिया-प्रतिक्रिया (action–reaction) के मामले में, tense में कोई परिवर्तन नहीं होगा।

Direct Speech: The event manager said, “As soon as Katy Perry started dancing everybody stood in praise.” <br>
Indirect Speech: The event manager said that as soon as Katy Perry started dancing everybody stood in praise.

Direct Speech: Jim said to Dwight, “when you opened the window, the wind came in.” <br>
Indirect Speech: Jim told Dwight that when he opened the window, the wind came in. 

#### अपवाद 3: अतीत में चल रही दो कार्रवाइयों के मामले में Tenses

भूतकाल में चल रही दो क्रियाओं (two ongoing actions) के मामले में, tense में कोई परिवर्तन नहीं होगा।

Direct Speech: Monika said, “while I was playing badminton some boys and girls were booing me”. <br>
Indirect Speech: Monika said that while she was playing badminton some boys and girls were booing her. (हमने सर्वनाम बदल दिया है, लेकिन tense नहीं) 

Direct Speech: Mragank said to Mayank, “while I was looking at you, you were looking at someone else.” <br>
Indirect Speech: Mragank told Mayank that while he was looking at him, he was looking at someone else.

#### अपवाद 4: सहायक क्रियाओं के मामले में Tenses (Tenses in case of helping verbs)

मोडल क्रियाओं (modal verbs) के मामले में, tense में कोई परिवर्तन नहीं होगा।

Direct Speech: He said, “There ***used to*** be a small school near my house.” <br>
Indirect Speech: He said that there ***used to*** be a small school near his house.  (हमने सर्वनाम बदल दिया है, लेकिन tense नहीं) 

Direct Speech: Parshuram said, “I ***would*** rather die than give the secret away to enemy.” <br>
Indirect Speech: Parshuram said that he ***would*** rather die than give the secret away to enemy.

<div class="toc-mak">
  <img src="../../../images/pencil.png">

यहाँ कुछ मोडल क्रियाएँ (modal verbs) दी गयी हैं:

will, shall, would, should, could, might, used to, ought to, need not, dare not etc.
